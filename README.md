In this FCC-ee analysis, we are interested in the final states with 2 leptonic Z bosons (ZH &rarr 4l + xx). Therefore, we have two possibilities concerning these leptonic Z bsosons. Indeed, we could have:
- two on shell leptonic Z bosons (case A) in the final state, 
- one on shell and one off shell leptonic Z bosons in the final state (case B).
